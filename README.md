# DiceLabs Go1 Simulation

This codebase is fairly simple and really only has two scripts of interest.
You'll find all the relevant code you need [here](Assest/Scripts). It contains a PathPlanning Script which will control the pipeline of the dog's movement. This can be thought of as the 'main' program that will be run and interact with other services provided from [this codebase](https://github.com/DiceLabs/go1) to perform all the needed functionality. The DogInterface is to bridge the Unity code to the python codebase.
